### NestJS Authenticate with GitHub template repo

This was a ride!

This template repo is set up with Passport JS and the ability to log in and authenticate users with GitHub.

It's important to note, that this template repo has the functionality to associate an existing app on GitHub and allow the developer to authenticate users with GitHub. 

I have purposefully left user management out of this scope, as different projects will require different storage solutions, entities, the purpose of this repo is to give you a working GitHub authentication out of the box. I haven't tested it yet, but since Passport has over a 100 different auth strategies, the code can very easily be repurposed to be used for other social logins, - i.e. Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.
